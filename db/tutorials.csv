<div class=""alert alert-info"" role=""alert"">
	<p>This tutorial walks you through setting up Ruby on Rails for the following Mac OSX versions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>10.9 (Mavericks)</li>
		<li>10.10 (Yosemite)</li>
		<li>10.11 (El Capitan)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you are using an earlier version of Mac, it is highly advisable to upgrade to a newer version.</p>
</div>

<h3>Setup steps in brief</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Install Command Line Tools</li>
	<li>Install Homebrew</li>
	<li>Install RVM and Ruby</li>
	<li>Install Rails</li>
</ol>

<h3>1.Install Command Line Tools</h3>
<p>The Command Line Tools are a part of Apple's XCode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but you can install the Tools on their own without XCode.</p>

<p>The Command Line Tools contain the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). This is a key component of the GNU Toolchain, a collection of tools used for developing software.</p>

<blockquote>This package enables UNIX-style development via Terminal by installing command line developer tools, as well as OS X SDK frameworks and headers. Many useful tools are included, such as the Apple LLVM compiler, linker, and Make.</blockquote>

<h4>1.1 Open your terminal</h4>
<p>1.2 Press Cmd + Space to bring up your Spotlight Search function. Type <code>terminal</code> and hit the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>
<p>1.3 When the terminal window has opened, type in the following command and hit <code>Enter</code></p>
<pre><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>

<p>1.4 You will be prompted to Install Command Line Tools. Click on the Install button, enter your password if asked and wait for the download to complete.</p>
<p>1.5 When the download has completed, install the download package</p>
<p>1.6 To check that the Command Line Tools are installed properly, type the following command into your terminal window</p>
<p><pre><code>gcc --version</code></pre></p>
<p>If the Command Line Tools are installed successfully, you will see output similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
  Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
  Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.2.0
  Thread model: posix
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Install Homebrew</h3>
<p><a href=""http://brew.sh/"" target=""_blank"">Homebrew</a> is a 'package manager' for OSX. It helps by installing and updating programming tools for your system.</p>

<p>2.1 In your terminal, copy the following command.</p>
<pre><code>ruby -e ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)""</code></pre>
<p>2.2 Keep an eye on the output in the terminal. It may ask you to hit the RETURN key or enter your computer's password.</p>
<div class=""alert alert-warning"">
	<p>NOTE: When you type your password into the terminal, it looks like your typing is not working - but it is. </p>
</div>
<p>2.3 When this install has completed type the following command into your terminal and hit Enter</p>
<pre><code>brew doctor</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>3. Install RVM (Ruby Version Manager) and Ruby</h3>
<p><a href=""https://rvm.io"" target=""_blank"">RVM</a> helps you manage multiple versions of Ruby on your machine (computer). This is future proofing your Mac so it is easier to upgrade your Ruby versions when needed.</p>

<p>3.1 Type the following command into your terminal and hit Enter.</p>
<pre><code>\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable</code></pre>
	
<p>This step may take a while to install all the required packages.</p>
<p>3.2 Once this process has completed and you are returned to the prompt, type (or copy) the following command into your terminal</p>
<pre><code>source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code></pre>

<p>3.3 Install the latest version of Ruby by typing the following command into your terminal.</p>
<pre><code>rvm install 2.2.3</code></pre>

<p>You can check which is the latest version of Ruby by visiting the <a href=""https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/"" target=""_blank"">official download page</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Install Ruby on Rails</h3>

<p>Rails is just a giant set of Ruby gems and you can use RVM to create 'gemsets' for different projects. A gemset is a specific version of Ruby associated with a particular version of Rails and associated gems.</p>

<p>4.1 Create a gemset by entering the following command in your terminal.</p>
<pre><code>rvm use ruby-2.2.3@rails-424 --create</code></pre>

<p>4.2 Install Ruby on Rails by entering the following command in your terminal.</p>
<pre><code>gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc</code></pre>

<p>This will take a couple of minutes to complete.</p>

<p>4.3 Set this as the default gemset for your system by entering the following command.</p>
<pre><code>rvm use ruby-2.2.3@rails-424 --default</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>You're done!</p>

<p>Test your system is ready by entering the following two commands and seeing the versions of Ruby and Rails</p>
<pre><code>ruby -v</code></pre>
<pre><code>rails -v</code></pre>
